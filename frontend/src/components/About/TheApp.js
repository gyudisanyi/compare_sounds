        This is a React/NodeJS+MySQL app running in a containerized environment, hosted at AWS.
        A personal project as a proof to myself and those interested of what I can do now.

        Also quite a lot of fun to use. Might even be useful.
        As a musician I always would have appreciated an easy way to cross-reference comparable audio on the fly, just switching tracks without needing to load them into any DAW. This can even be shared, neat.

        I made <a href="/sanyi">examples</a> with several use cases in mind.

        Also, mind me, it is about audio - I'll love to hear people using it in unexpected ways!

        This is my first complete app, I did it on my own but not alone. Had great help from my friend dzac and of course strangers from the internet. 
        I had to explore and discover things I wasn't expecting.
