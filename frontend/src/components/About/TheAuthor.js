      <p>
        I'm a late bloomer in coding. The seeds were sown in my childhood years, some sprouts 
        - amusing network breach stories - got me a reputation in weeks into highschool 
        and a principals'notice.

        I didn't keep on coding much in my adult years. My other interests drove me to a 
        degree in Visual Arts and the jazz double bass. Not being afraid of codes was great 
        freelancing with graphics - did HTML/CSS3 static pages or driven by PimCore CMS set up
        by another guy.

        Then I found love, moved to another town and founded a family, and however better 
        opportunities Budapest gave me to play music, I needed to find a more secure income. The 
        infamous year 2020 gave me a lot of incentive - and also a lot of time - so the thing 
        in the back of my mind came to the front again, let's turn this childhood passion 
        into profession! And now here I am having flashbacks of how I felt when I tweaked 
        the snakes game to give me 30 lives and push me to the next level when I hit the wall.
