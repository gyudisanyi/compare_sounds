# compare_sounds v.0.0.0.7345

This is a React/NodeJS+MySQL app <a href="https://cs.sanyi.space/"> living </a> in composed AWS dockers. A personal project as a proof to myself and those interested of what I can do now.

Also quite a lot of fun to use. Might even be useful.

As a musician I always would have appreciated an easy way to cross-reference comparable audio on the fly, just switching tracks without needing to load them into any DAW. This can even be shared, neat.

I made <a href="https://cs.sanyi.space/sanyi"> examples </a> with several use cases in mind.

Also, mind me, it is about audio - I'll love to hear people using it in unexpected ways!

This is my first complete app, I did it on my own but not alone. Had great help from my friend dzac and of course strangers from the internet. 
I had to explore and discover things I wasn't expecting.

I call it Nested Rabbithole Methodology. For the IT equivalent of <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>En attendant Godot</i> check the commits.

Thanks! Start playing!
